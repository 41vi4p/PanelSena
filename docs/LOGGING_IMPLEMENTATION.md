# Logging Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the complete logging functionality implementation for PanelSena v1.7.2.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Logs Page Integration** (`app/dashboard/logs/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Connected to Firebase using `useActivities` hook
- ✅ Real-time activity updates from Firestore
- ✅ Activity type to log severity mapping (info, warning, error, success)
- ✅ Search functionality across actions and descriptions
- ✅ Filter by log type (All, Success, Warning, Error)
- ✅ Export logs to JSON functionality
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Protected route (authentication required)

### 2. **Activity Logging in Display Operations** (`app/dashboard/displays/page.tsx`)
The following display operations now log activities:
- ✅ Display Created - Logs when a new display is added
- ✅ Display Updated - Logs when display settings are changed
- ✅ Display Deleted - Logs when a display is removed
- ✅ Device Linked Successfully - Logs successful Raspberry Pi device linking
- ✅ Device Link Error - Logs failed device linking attempts
- ✅ Display Error - Logs any display operation errors

### 3. **Activity Logging in Content Operations** (`hooks/use-content.ts`)
The following content operations now log activities:
- ✅ Content Uploaded - Logs successful file uploads (images, videos, documents)
- ✅ Content Upload Error - Logs failed upload attempts
- ✅ Content Deleted - Logs when content is removed
- ✅ Content Delete Error - Logs failed deletion attempts

### 4. **Activity Logging in Schedule Operations** (`hooks/use-schedules.ts`)
The following schedule operations now log activities:
- ✅ Schedule Created - Logs when a new schedule is created
- ✅ Schedule Create Error - Logs failed schedule creation
- ✅ Schedule Updated - Logs schedule modifications
- ✅ Schedule Update Error - Logs failed schedule updates
- ✅ Schedule Deleted - Logs schedule deletions
- ✅ Schedule Delete Error - Logs failed schedule deletions

## Log Type Classification

### Automatic Type Mapping
The logs page automatically determines severity based on keywords in actions:

| Keywords | Log Type | Color |
|----------|----------|-------|
| error, failed, delete | Error | Red |
| warning, offline | Warning | Yellow |
| success, created, uploaded, linked | Success | Green |
| (default) | Info | Blue |

## Data Structure

### Activity Type (Firestore)
```typescript
interface Activity {
  id: string
  userId: string
  type: 'display' | 'content' | 'schedule' | 'system'
  action: string           // e.g., "Display Created"
  description: string      // e.g., "Created new display 'Main Lobby'"
  metadata?: {            // Optional additional data
    displayName?: string
    displayId?: string
    contentName?: string
    contentType?: string
    scheduleName?: string
    scheduleId?: string
    error?: string
  }
  timestamp: string
}
```

### Log Display Format
```typescript
interface LogEntry {
  id: string
  timestamp: Date
  type: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'success'
  action: string
  description: string
  metadata?: Record<string, any>
}
```

## Features

### Search & Filter
- **Search**: Type to search across action names and descriptions
- **Filter by Type**: Click All, Success, Warning, or Error buttons
- **Real-time Updates**: Logs update automatically as activities occur

### Export Functionality
- Click the "Export" button to download logs as JSON
- Filename format: `logs_YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- Exports currently filtered logs

### Timestamps
- Relative time display (e.g., "2m ago", "5h ago", "3d ago")
- Automatic formatting based on age of log entry

## Database Collections

### Firestore Collection: `activities`
Path: `users/{userId}/activities/{activityId}`

Fields:
- `type`: Activity category (display/content/schedule/system)
- `action`: Short action name
- `description`: Detailed description
- `metadata`: Additional contextual data
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Logs
1. Navigate to Dashboard > Logs
2. View all recent activities in chronological order
3. Use search box to find specific activities
4. Click filter buttons to show only certain types

### Interpreting Logs
- **Green (Success)**: Operations completed successfully
- **Blue (Info)**: General information about system activities
- **Yellow (Warning)**: Non-critical issues or status changes
- **Red (Error)**: Failed operations or critical issues

### Exporting Logs
1. Apply filters/search if needed
2. Click "Export" button
3. JSON file downloads with filtered logs
4. Can be opened in any text editor or JSON viewer

## API Functions

### From `useActivities` Hook
```typescript
const { activities, loading, error, logActivity } = useActivities(userId, limit)

// Log a new activity
await logActivity(
  type: 'display' | 'content' | 'schedule' | 'system',
  action: string,
  description: string,
  metadata?: Record<string, any>
)
```

### From Firestore
```typescript
// Create activity
await createActivity(userId, activityData)

// Subscribe to activities
const unsubscribe = subscribeToActivities(userId, callback, limit)

// Get user activities
const activities = await getUserActivities(userId, limit)
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Limit**: Default 100 activities loaded (configurable via `limit` parameter)
- **Real-time**: Uses Firestore real-time listeners for instant updates
- **Indexing**: Activities ordered by timestamp (descending)
- **Cleanup**: Old activities can be archived/deleted via Firebase Functions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Date range filtering
- [ ] Activity type filtering (display/content/schedule/system)
- [ ] Bulk delete old logs
- [ ] CSV export option
- [ ] Email notifications for errors
- [ ] Activity analytics dashboard
- [ ] Log retention policies
- [ ] Advanced search with operators

## Testing

To verify logging is working:

1. **Display Logging**:
   - Add a new display → Check for "Display Created" log
   - Edit display → Check for "Display Updated" log
   - Link device → Check for "Device Linked Successfully" log
   - Delete display → Check for "Display Deleted" log

2. **Content Logging**:
   - Upload a file → Check for "Content Uploaded" log
   - Delete content → Check for "Content Deleted" log

3. **Schedule Logging**:
   - Create schedule → Check for "Schedule Created" log
   - Edit schedule → Check for "Schedule Updated" log
   - Delete schedule → Check for "Schedule Deleted" log

4. **Error Logging**:
   - Trigger any operation failure → Check for appropriate error log
